# functionality
/users/{username}/repositories
can use parameter ?filter=(focked, nonforked, all (by default))
on first query system cache the pages - pagination is used so app goes through all 
  pages and saves pages and ETags. Next time with the same page it sends etag and if
  we have 304 reponse take page from cache. (At first I have done loading the pages 
  from cache in the event of network problems, later decided against it).
All configurations in the application.yaml
